Hi! I am an AI Specialist with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Campinas, Brazil. My doctoral research, conducted under the [DejáVù Project](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~dejavu/) and advised by Prof. [Anderson Rocha](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/) at the [Artificial Intelligence (Recod.ai) lab](http://recod.ai/) lab, focused on developing AI methods to identify whether social media content is connected to specific forensic events. Today, I leverage this expertise to design and apply AI solutions that address real-world challenges.
