Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Campinas, Brazil, where my advisor is Prof. [Anderson Rocha](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/), and I am a member of the [Artificial Intelligence (Recod.ai) lab](http://recod.ai/).

My areas of research are machine learning and multimedia forensics. Specifically, I work on the development of an automated method to determine whether a piece of social media data is related or not to a given forensic event.

Currently, I am in an internship at the Polytechnic University of Milan, under the supervision of Prof. [Paolo Bestagini](https://bestagini.faculty.polimi.it/) at the [Image and Sound Processing Lab (ISPL)](http://ispl.deib.polimi.it/).
