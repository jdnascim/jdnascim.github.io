Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Campinas, Brazil, where my advisor is Prof. [Anderson Rocha](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~rocha/), and I am a member of the [Artificial Intelligence (Recod.ai) lab](http://recod.ai/).

My areas of research are machine learning and multimedia forensics. Specifically, I work under the [DejáVù Project](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~dejavu/) on the development of an automated method to determine whether a piece of social media data is related or not to a given forensic event.
