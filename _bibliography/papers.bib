  title={Semi-Supervised Feature Embedding for Data Sanitization in Real-World Events},
  abstract={With the rapid growth of data sharing through social media networks, determining relevant data items concerning a particular subject becomes paramount. We address the issue of establishing which images represent an event of interest through a semi-supervised learning technique. The method learns consistent and shared features related to an event (from a small set of examples) to propagate them to an unlabeled set. We investigate the behavior of five image feature representations considering low- and high-level features and their combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the feature embedding approach on five collected datasets from real-world events.},

  title={Few-shot Learning for Multi-modal Social Media Event Filtering},
  abstract={When a forensic event of large scale happens, immediately visual content related to it is shared on social networks. These data might be potentially useful for a posterior forensic inspection, given that they can depict different views in different moments of the event. However, an analysis of social media imagery related to an event might be harmed by the abundant number of irrelevant items that are retrieved by a collection procedure, such as memes and images from previous events. Manually sanitizing the dataset at hand is unfeasible, since it might contain thousands of items. To tackle this problem, we study the employment of machine learning techniques to speed up the procedure and reduce the required human force. In detail, our work follows four paths. The first one aims to provide a good representation for images, exploring different pre-trained convolutional neural networks and feature fusion; the second one targets including humans to the loop of the machine learning pipeline, by employing instance selection and active learning techniques; the goal of the third one is to perform classification with few samples, using semi-supervised techniques that vary from graph-based methods to graph neural networks; and the last one aims to incorporate knowledge from previous events to the machine learning pipeline, using domain adaptation and available datasets from previous events. These four paths are promising, and can improve the performance of methods for this task.},
