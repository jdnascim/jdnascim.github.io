  title={Semi-Supervised Feature Embedding for Data Sanitization in Real-World Events},
  abstract={With the rapid growth of data sharing through social media networks, determining relevant data items concerning a particular subject becomes paramount. We address the issue of establishing which images represent an event of interest through a semi-supervised learning technique. The method learns consistent and shared features related to an event (from a small set of examples) to propagate them to an unlabeled set. We investigate the behavior of five image feature representations considering low- and high-level features and their combinations. We evaluate the effectiveness of the feature embedding approach on five collected datasets from real-world events.},
